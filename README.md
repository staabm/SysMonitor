SysMonitor
==========

Monitors a php app and sends notifications on certain errohhr/exception/resource-exhausting/custom/etc. events.

The monitor checks the data you provide and decides with a naive default implementation (see `SystemMonitor#rateAndStore`) when things get urgent/severe. `SystemEvent`s are compared using a hash so times of occurence can also be based on similarity.
Notifications are beeing send in such cases, depending on your used Notifier.

The default implementation of `SystemEventStorage` stores your data in a mix of APC and Memcached. Therefore it requires both php extensions.

Usage
=====

init all the things. All classes prefixed with `My` need to be provided by the application/framework beeing monitored.

```php
// sends notificaitons on urgent events
$notifier = new SeverityNotifier(new MyCustomNotifier(), SystemEvent::SEVERITY_URGENT);
// main class which collects all the data
$monitor = new SystemMonitor(new SystemEventStorage(), new MyRequestEnvImpl(), $notifier);
```

report performance-data from somewhere in your app (e.g. on request shutdown)

```php
register_shutdown_function(function() {
    $requestStats = new RequestStatsEvent();
    // data from your db class
    $requestStats->usedQueries = DB::$num_of_queries;
    $requestStats->usedConnections = DB::$num_of_connections;
    // data from your runtime
    $requestStats->peakMemory = number_format(memory_get_peak_usage(true) / 1024 / 1024);
    
    // retrieve the monitor instance, e.g. via a DIC/a registry/singleton/whatever
    // $monitor = .. 
    $monitor->collectStats($requestStats);
});
```

let the `Monitor` collect data about exceptions occured

```php
set_exception_handler(function() {
    $event = new RequestExceptionEvent();
    $event->exception = $exception;
    
    // retrieve the monitor instance, e.g. via a DIC/a registry/singleton/whatever
    // $monitor = .. 
    $monitor->collectException($event);
});
```

you could do the same for errors. To collect data of fatal errors there are some known workarounds which can be used (checking for `error_get_last()` in a shutdown function)


Sidenote
========

This library was extracted out of a framework and contains some "strange" things which are kept for BC reasons.
This will be changed in version 2.0.
